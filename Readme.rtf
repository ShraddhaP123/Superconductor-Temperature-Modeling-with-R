There are two files:
(1) train.csv contains 81 features extracted from 21263 superconductors along with the critical temperature in the 82nd column
(2) unique_m.csv contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263 superconductors from the train.csv file.

The original data comes from http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html which is public.

Goal: The goal here is to predict the critical temperature based on the features extracted.
